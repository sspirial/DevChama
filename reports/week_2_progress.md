# DevChama Project â€“ Week 2 Progress Report
**Date:** October 18, 2025  
**Owner:** Emmanuel Munubi  
**Sprint:** Week 2 â€“ Core Chama Features

---

## 1. Highlights & Deliverables
- **User Management**
  - Added registration endpoint with password validation and profile retrieval/update APIs (`POST /api/auth/register/`, `GET|PUT /api/auth/profile/`).
- **Access Control**
  - Introduced custom permission helpers for chama-based roles.
  - Scoped list/detail endpoints so members only see chamas, contributions, tasks, and rewards they belong to.
- **Membership Management**
  - Prevented duplicate joins, enabled admins to invite/promote/demote, and added self-serve leave endpoint (`DELETE /api/chamas/<id>/members/me/`).
  - Added "My Chamas" view (`GET /api/me/chamas/`).
- **Task & Contribution Validation**
  - Enforced monetary contribution rules, ensured task assignees are members, and exposed `assigned_to_user_id` helper for API clients.
- **Automated Tests**
  - Added seven API/serializer test cases covering membership flows, task permissions, and contribution validation (`manage.py test api`).
- **API Documentation**
  - Integrated drf-spectacular with Swagger UI (`/api/docs/`), Redoc (`/api/redoc/`), and JSON schema (`/api/schema/`).
  - Published starter Postman/Insomnia collection (`api_collection.json`).

## 2. Challenges & Resolutions
| Challenge | Impact | Resolution |
|-----------|--------|------------|
| Aligning chama-level permissions with Djangoâ€™s auth model | Needed granular control by group role | Built reusable helpers (`is_chama_member`, `is_chama_admin`) and custom DRF permission classes applied across viewsets |
| Handling membership edge cases (duplicate joins, owner leaving) | Risk of inconsistent state | Added validation paths and explicit error handling; prevented owner from leaving without transfer |
| Documenting rapidly evolving APIs | Ensuring consumers stay up-to-date | Adopted drf-spectacular to auto-generate schema and exposed friendly docs endpoints |

## 3. Quality Gates
- âœ… `python manage.py check`
- âœ… `python manage.py test api` (7 tests, all passing)
- ðŸ”„ No lint suite configured yet (recommend adding `flake8`/`ruff` in Week 3)

## 4. Whatâ€™s Next (Week 3 Plan)
1. **Contributions & Task Enhancements**
   - Implement points calculation logic and task status transitions with audit trail.
   - Add filters/search to contributions and tasks endpoints (by type, status, due date).
2. **Dashboard Foundations**
   - Prepare summary endpoints for contributions and tasks to seed analytics/dashboards (planned Week 4).
3. **Frontend Kickoff (Stretch)**
   - Scaffold frontend project (Next.js/React) and consume newly documented API endpoints.
4. **Engineering Hygiene**
   - Add lint/type checks to CI.
   - Extend automated tests (reward distribution, nested membership permissions).

## 5. Risks & Mitigations
- **Permissions Complexity** â€“ Continue writing targeted tests as new roles/actions are added.
- **Scope Creep** â€“ Keep integrations (GitHub, M-Pesa) parked until core contributions and dashboards are stable.
- **Testing Coverage** â€“ Expand tests incrementally; consider coverage reporting in CI.

## 6. Reference Artifacts
- Project Plan: `PROJECT_PLAN.md`
- API Spec: `API_SPEC.md`
- Backend README & setup: `backend/README.md`
- Postman Collection: `api_collection.json`
- Test Suite: `backend/api/tests/`
- API Docs: `/api/docs/`, `/api/redoc/`

**Summary:** Week 2 delivered end-to-end chama membership management, robust permission enforcement, stronger validation, and working API documentation with tests. The backend is ready for Week 3â€™s focus on contribution metrics, task workflows, and dashboard groundwork.
