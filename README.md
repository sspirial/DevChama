DevChama — Developer Cooperative Platform

Short description
DevChama adapts the chama model for developer collaboration: members pool code, time, skills, and optional funds to build shared projects and share rewards.

Contents in this folder
- PROJECT_PLAN.md — Full 5-week project plan, features, data models, timeline, and acceptance criteria.
- API_SPEC.md — REST API surface, endpoint descriptions, example request/response shapes.

How to use this plan
1. Review the project plan and accept the scope and timeline.
2. Initialize a git repo at `/home/munubi/DevChama` and scaffold the chosen stack (Node/Express + Postgres recommended for MVP).
3. Create issues aligned with the weekly timeline; start with Week 1 issues: schema design, auth, and basic user CRUD.
4. Use `API_SPEC.md` when implementing backend routes; extend with request/response validations (OpenAPI recommended).
